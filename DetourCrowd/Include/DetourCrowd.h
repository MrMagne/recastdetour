@defgroup crowd Crowd Management

This module is about handling multiple agents.

`dtCrowd` is the class representing a crowd. 

A crowd handles every agent it contains. 
You can think of it as a big container for agents.

You can see `dtCrowd` as an interface between you and the agents it contains.
You cannot modify the agents inside the crowd directly, 
the interface will only grant you a constant access to the data.

Through `dtCrowd` you can do several things:

- Have constant access to the agents
- Have access to the data the crowd uses to update the agents (navigation mesh, proximity grid, environment, etc.)
- Add / Remove / Edit agents inside the crowd via some specific methods
- Update the crowd. This will update every agents using their behaviors. When updating an agent you can 
update its position, velocity, environment or all of those.


# How to create a crowd

Here is a sample code for creating a crowd:

@code
// Creation of the crowd.
dtCrowd crowd;
// How many agents can the crowd contain?
int nbMaxAgents = 1000;
// The maximum radius for an agent
float maxRadius = 10.f;
// How close should an element be before being considered as an obstacle?
float collisionRange = 4.f;

// Note: the navigation mesh must already be initialized
// The navigation mesh will be used by the agents for navigation
crowd.init(nbMaxAgents, mawRadius, navigationMesh, collisionRange);
@endcode

You now have a crowd ready to work, but empty...

# Agents

`dtCrowdAgent` is the class representing an agent.

An agent is an entity inside a crowd with several properties. The most important of these is the `dtCrowdAgent::id` property.

@warning Each agent is identified by its id, and the crowd handles its agents using these ids. Therefore the user __should 
not__ modify the id of an agent by himself. The ids are generated by crowd and are unique.

# Add an agent to the crowd

When you create a crowd, you create the agents at the same time. Indeed the crowd will create N agents, 
N being the maximum of agents you specified when creating the crowd, and set them as inactive. 
If inactive, an agent won't be taken into account during the process of updating the crowd.

Here is how you can toggle an agent as active/inactive:

@code
// The position you want to place your agent at
float position[] = {0, 0, 0};
dtCrowdAgent agent;

if (crowd.addAgent(agent, position) == false)
	// Error The agent could not be added to the crowd

// At this point, agent has been added and set as active. Its data (and id) have been updated.

// You can also remove the agent from the crowd, which will set him as inactive
crowd.removeAgent(ag.id);
@endcode

With the method `dtCrowd::addAgent()` we can toggle an agent as active an place it at a specific point on the navigation mesh. 
The method will copy the data of the newly created agent into the agent structure you provided. 
You can use the id of the agent later on to get access to it thanks to the method `dtCrowd::getAgent()`.

Your crowd now contains one agent.

# Access and edit existing agents

`dtCrowd` does not allow you to directly edit the agents. You need to get a copy of the agent, edit it, then send the modifications to the crowd.
In any case, you will need the id of an agent in order to retrieve it.

Here is a code illustrating the different ways to access agents:

@code
// You can get a const access to an agent with its id
const dtCrowdAgent* ag = crowd.getAgent(id);

// You can fetch an agent and copy the data into another agent
dtCrowdAgent myAgent;
crowd.fetchAgent(myAgent, id);

// You can also get several agents at the same time
int ids[] = {1, 2, 3, 6};
const dtCrowdAgent* agents[4];
int nbAgentsFound = crowd.getAgents(ids, 4, agents);
@endcode

Now that you have accessed your agent, you might want to modify some of its properties, and then send the changes to the crowd, 
here is how this can be acheived:

@code
// Fetch the agent you want to edit
dtCrowdAgent ag;
crowd.fetchAgent(ag, id); // The data have been copied into ag (including the id)

// Edit the properties
ag.maxSpeed *= 2;
ag.radius = 10;
ag.height = 500;
// ...

// You can now send the changes to the crowd
crowd.applyAgent(ag);
@endcode

@warning `dtCrowd` uses the id when looking for and editing an agent, therefore be careful not the change the id property of an agent, 
otherwise the crowd might not update the right agent.

# Update the crowd

When you update the crowd, by default, all the active agents inside this crowd will be updated. 
But maybe you just want some of them to be updated. This can be done by providing a list of agents' ids.

@note When updating the agents, the crowd will use the behaviors assigned to them. See the @ref behavior module for more details.

@code
float position1[] = {0, 0, 0};
float position2[] = {1, 0, 1};
float position3[] = {2, 0, 2};

dtCrowdAgent ag1, ag2, ag3;

if (!crowd.addAgent(ag1, position1) || !crowd.addAgent(ag2, position2) || !crowd.addAgent(ag3, position3))
	return false;

// ...

// Updates every active agents inside the crowd.
crowd.update(dt); // dt is the delta time to update the simulation.

int list[2];
list[0] = ag2.id;
list[1] = ag3.id;

// Just the agents 2 and 3 will be updated.
crowd.update(dt, list, 2);

// Just the agent corresponding to index2 will be updated (since we say the list has a size of 1).
crowd.update(dt, list, 1);
@endcode

Crowds updating is a three parts process, for each agent we do the following:

- __Updating the environment:__ Updates the proximity grid and registers every agent's neighbor. This will take into account 
things like other agents, boundaries, obstacles, etc. The range of the environment depends on the agent's property `dtCrowd::collisionQueryRange`.
- __Updating the velocity:__ Updates the velocity of the agent. This uses the behaviors assigned to the agent. These behaviors will compute a new velocity 
for the agent.
- __Updating the position:__ Updates the position of the agent using the previously computed velocity.

The calls order should be this:

- Update the environment so the agent knows what is around him,
- Update the velocity using a behavior,
- Update the position using the new velocity.

You can individually call these updates using the following methods:

- `dtCrowd::updateEnvironment()`
- `dtCrowd::updateVelocity()`
- `dtCrowd::updatePosition()`

@note Calling the method `dtCrowd::update()` will call all three methods listed above.

# Other features

## Change the position of an agent

Of course the position of an agent will be updated trough its behavior(s), but sometimes you might want to 
set your agent at a given position instantly, without the constraints of a behavior (for instance your agent 
have walked on a teleporter). This can be done using the `dtCrowd::updateAgentPosition()` method:

@code
float newPosition[] = {10, 0, 0};

if (crowd.updateAgentPosition(agentId, newPosition))
	// Done, your agent has moved
else
	// Something went wrong, either the position is invalid or the given id was out of bounds
@endcode

## Access the environment of an agent

The environment of an agent contains many informations that can be useful for some behavior 
(for instance it is used by the behavior `dtCollisionAvoidance`).

You can retreive the environment of an agent by using the method `dtCrowd::getAgentEnvironment`.

## The Crowd Query

`dtCrowdQuery` contains informations that `dtCrowd` uses and that might be useful for the user.
It contains things like the proximity grid, the animations of the agents, the `dtNavMeshQuery`, etc.

Since it might often be useful, `dtCrowd` provides an easy access via the method `dtCrowd::getCrowdQuery()`.
